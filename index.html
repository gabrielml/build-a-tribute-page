                    creatine metabolism. Returning to Spain submitted a paper describing the work to the <em>Journal of
                        Biological Chemistry</em> marking the beginning of Ochoa's biochemistry career</p>

                    Berlin-Dahlem. Interacting with scientists such as Otto Warburg, Carl Neuberg, Einar Lundsgaard and
                    Fritz Lipmann in addition to Meyerhof. The Institute was a <em>hot bed</em> of the discipline of
